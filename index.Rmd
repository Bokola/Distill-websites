### Hello!

Welcome to my personal (work in progress) site. I am student enrolled into  Master of Science degree in Statistics and data science, specializing in biostatistics. I use R, SAS and Python for statistical analysis and visualizations. Kindly find some of those in the portfolio tab. I am also looking to collaborate in projects and publishable work.

I hold an undergraduate BS Applied Statistics degree having previously held roles in data management and analysis.
