### Hello!

Welcome to my personal (work in progress) site. I am student at [Hasselt University](https://www.uhasselt.be), enrolled into  Master of Science degree in Statistics and data science, specializing in Biostatistics. I use R, SAS and Python for statistical analysis and visualizations. Kindly find some of those in the portfolio tab. I am also looking to collaborate in publishable work, so do reach out!

I hold an undergraduate BS Applied Statistics degree from [Maseno University](https://www.maseno.ac.ke/index/) having previously held roles in data management and analysis at [Kemri-Wellcome Trust](https://kemri-wellcome.org/)
